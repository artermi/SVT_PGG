# Spatial versus Temporal Randomness in Public Goods Cooperation

## Core Question
If two public-goods games have the same mean and variance of the synergy factor $r$, does it matter whether the randomness is frozen in space (different sites, fixed in time) or shuffled in time (same for everyone, changes every $\tau$ step)?


## 0.  Symbol Key (quick reference)
{@{}ll@{}}
\(r\)      & synergy factor \\
\(L\)      & lattice side length (sites per row) \\
\(N=L^{2}\)& total number of agents \\
\(G\)      & group size \(\;(=5)\) \\
\(r_{g}(t)\)& synergy factor used by group \(g\) at time \(t\) \\
\(f(r)\)   & probability law from which all \(r\)-values are drawn \\
\(r_{0}\)  & mean of \(f(r)\) (baseline synergy) \\
\(\sigma^{2}\)& variance of \(f(r)\) \\
\(s_{i}(t)\)& strategy of agent \(i\) at time \(t\) (1=C, 0=D) \\
\(K\)      & selection “temperature’’ in Fermi rule \\
\(\tau\)   & refresh period for Model B (temporal noise) \\
